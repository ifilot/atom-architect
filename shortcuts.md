## Geometry

* `g`: Grab the atoms in the primary buffer. You can follow by `x`,`y`,`z` to constrain the movement to a Cartesian direction or press `f` for a focal points (second buffer).
* `r`: Rotate the atoms in the primary buffer. You can follow by `x`,`y`,`z` to constrain the rotation to an axis parallel to a Cartesian direction or press `f` for a focal points (secondary buffer).
* `del`: Delete the atoms in the primary buffer.
* `SHIFT+A`: Add fragment to the system. The primary buffer will be used to set the position, the secondary buffer is used to construct a direction vector.

## Selection

* `CTRL+D`: Deselect all atoms
* `CTRL+A`: Select all atoms
* `CTRL+I`: Invert selection

## Constraints
